# Lesson 3: Calculus:
This is the third lesson of the Advanced Programming course with the following objectives:
* i) Understand about another source code which implements some math functions namely sin(x), cos(x), sqrt(x)
* ii) Learn about the automated testing with github Actions.

You are required to implement several functions of Calculus. They could be done via the instructions as follows:

* Step 1: Fork this repo to your own account
* Step 2: Clone the forked repo to your local via the command: git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/AdvProg_L2-Calculus.git
* Step 3: Modify the "calculus.cpp" file to complete the requirement.
* Step 4: Commit & push the modified file using the command: git commit -m "[Insert_your_own_message]" & git push origin main
* Step 5: Create a pull request:
In the tab "Pull requests", click on "New pull request"
Set the pull request's title with the format as: [Your_student_ID]_[Your_full_name]
Click on "Create pull request" to submit
* Step 6: Check the automated testing workflow on your modified code using Github Actions.
Hope you enjoy the lesson.
